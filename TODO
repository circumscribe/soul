2.4:

 + fixed bug that broke using soul under non-LaTeX

 - \inputenc{latin9}\uppercase{\so{Êﬂ}}

 - However, if I introduce a spacing macro immediately
   after the \hfill\caps{}, \medskip for example, extra
   spacing is inserted after the small caps text, eg.

   \hfill\caps{some text}
   \medskip
